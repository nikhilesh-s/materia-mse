## Setup Instructions

### 1. Supabase Setup

1. Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to Settings → API and copy your:
   - Project URL
   - Anon public key
   - Service role key (for admin functions)

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory (see `.env.example`):

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key_here

# Email Configuration (optional)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com
```

### 3. Database Setup

The database schema will be automatically created when you first connect to Supabase. The migrations include:

- **blog_posts**: Blog content management
- **comments**: Blog post comments (with approval system)
- **community_members**: Member applications and management
- **newsletter_subscribers**: Email subscription management

### 4. Email Setup (Optional)

For email functionality:

1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Get your API key
3. Add it to your environment variables
4. Configure your domain for sending emails

### 5. Edge Functions

The following Supabase Edge Functions are included:

- **send-newsletter-confirmation**: Sends welcome emails to newsletter subscribers
- **send-application-notification**: Sends confirmation emails for community applications
- **send-newsletter-email**: Sends blog post notifications to subscribers

These functions will work automatically once your Supabase project is set up.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Deployment (Vercel)

Deploy on Vercel and set these environment variables in the Vercel project settings:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `RESEND_API_KEY` (optional)
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` (optional)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`

## Adding Pages/Routes

This project uses a single-page layout with hash routing in `MainContent`.
To add a new section:

1. Create a new component in `components/pages/`.
2. Export it from `components/pages/index.tsx`.
3. Render it in `components/main-content.tsx` and map it to a hash.

## Usage

### Admin Access

Navigate to `/#admin` to access the admin dashboard. Here you can:

- Manage blog posts (publish/unpublish)
- Review and approve community member applications
- View newsletter subscribers
- Send newsletter emails when publishing posts

### Content Management

- Blog posts are managed through the admin dashboard
- Comments require approval before appearing
- Community applications go through an approval process
- Newsletter subscriptions are automatic but can be managed

### Fallback Behavior

The application gracefully handles missing Supabase configuration:
